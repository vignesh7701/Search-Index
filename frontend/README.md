# Frontend Project

This project provides a simple frontend interface to test the search functionality of the existing backend.

## Files

- **index.html**: Contains the HTML structure for the frontend, including a centered search bar for user input.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Enter your search query in the search bar.
3. Click the "Search" button to submit your query to the backend.
4. The results will be displayed based on the search functionality implemented in the backend.

## Notes

- Ensure that the backend server is running and accessible for the search functionality to work.
- You can modify the search bar and styles in `index.html` as needed to fit your design preferences.
